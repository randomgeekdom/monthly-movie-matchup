    <h1>What is the monthly movie matchup?</h1>
    <p>
      Each week, you get 500 picpoints to spend on up to 9 movies in an attempt
      to guess the highest combined U.S. domestic boxoffice. You have until
      11:59 PM Pacific Time Thursday to make your selections. Do this until the
      last weekend of the month and then see who has the highest score.
